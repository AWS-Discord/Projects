# Projects
This repository contains project ideas for those that are new to AWS or DevOps and want some real world experience to add to their skillsets.
They're intended for people who have some experience with AWS already, familiarity with at least one programming language, and possession of the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification.

# Rules
 - Fork the repository to your own github and work out of that.
 - While it's not required to start with Infrastructure as Code, final products should be written as Terraform code for evaluation.
 - When you feel you've completed the acceptance criteria, you can post your forked repo to the General-AWS channel for review.
